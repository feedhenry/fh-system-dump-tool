                 The RHMAP Dump and Analysis Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This tool is used to take a dump of the current state of the
Red Hat Mobile Application Platform along with all relevant log
files and create a tar.gz file which contains all of this data.

This tool is also able to read a tar.gz file created in that
way and scan for common issues and alert the user to potential
issues that may currently be affecting the platform.

# Dump Task
===========
The dump task will take a snapshot of the system along with
pertinent log files and dump them into the desired location,
specified by the -f flag, or defaulting to this directory:
rhmap-dumps/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

This will also include some information about the version of
the system-dump tool used to create the dump.

Example Usage:
fh-system-dump-tool -t=dump -f=~/deploy-issues-2016-06-12.tar.gz

# Analyse Task
==============
The analyse task will be run against a previously created dump
file, which it will unzip and scan for known issues. The issues
it will be able to detect depend on 2 factors
1) The version of the tool used to create the dump file
2) The version of the tool used to analyse the dump file

Example Usage:
fh-system-dump-tool -t=analyse -f=~/deploy-issues-2016-06-12.tar.gz
